Bindings to Erlang's `hackney` HTTP client.

Most the time [`gleam_httpc`](https://github.com/gleam-lang/httpc) is a better
choice as it uses the built-in Erlang HTTP client, but this package may be
useful in some specific situations.

```shell
gleam add gleam_hackney@1
```
```gleam
import gleam/result
import gleam/hackney
import gleam/http/request
import gleam/http/response
import gleeunit/should

pub fn main() {
  // Prepare a HTTP request record
  let assert Ok(request) =
    request.to("https://test-api.service.hmrc.gov.uk/hello/world")

  // Send the HTTP request to the server
  use response <- result.try(
    request
    |> request.prepend_header("accept", "application/vnd.hmrc.1.0+json")
    |> hackney.send
  )

  // We get a response record back
  assert response.status == 200

  assert response.get_header(response, "content-type")
    == Ok("application/json")

  assert response.body
    == "{\"message\":\"Hello World\"}")
}
```
